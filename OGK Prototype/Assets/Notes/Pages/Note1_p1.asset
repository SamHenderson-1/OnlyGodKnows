  text: "Excerpt From the Journal of Robert Carpenter\r\n    Thank you Lord, for
    sending your angel to watch over our parish. We are undeserving of your gifts
    but you show us boundless mercy and for that I am grateful. Our work in spreading
    the good news has not been and will not be easy but I place my faith in you oh
    Lord and in the blessed angel that we will be successful in our work. Thank you
    for revealing to us through the angel a place where we may continue our work
    away from the prying eyes of those who do not want to believe. We will make them
    believe in time. But for now we shall leave Midwich and head to our Canaan so
    we may continue our blessed mission. "
